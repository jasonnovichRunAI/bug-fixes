## About the changelog

The **Changelog** file is a list of known and fixed issues for all of the versions of software.

There is a file for each version of the software with a list of all the hotfix versions in each of the version files.

The table for the known and fixed issues contains 3 columns:

* **Internal ID**&mdash;this is the "key" to find the issue in Run:ai's tracking system.
* **Description**&mdash;a one line description of the issue. Contact Run:ai for more details using the *Internal ID* as the key.
* **Release version**&mdash;the versions that contain the known or fixed issue. Multiple issues will be listed

## Notes

* There will be only one instance of any issue in the table.
* The entries in the *Release version* will be listed in order of newest to oldest.
* Entries will be put in the table based on the newest *Release version* where it was discovered. All other versions will be listed in descending order.
* Use **mkdocs.yaml** to show/hide version list per branch.

Checking to see if this updates all of the branches.
